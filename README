PCB111000 has beeen developed as a learning aid for the C language when applied to AVR devices.  
It consists of a USB bridge to communicate with a PC, an 8 digit display and two AVR devices. One of the AVR devices hosts a miniOS which drives the display and
the other, the user device, hosts user projects.

There are three versions of PCB111000:

PCB_111000_V2 using two Atmega devices and the FTDI FT230XS USB bridge
PCB_111000_UNO_V2 A simplified plug in version for use with the UNO
PCB_111000_CP2102 Using one Atmega one ATtiny and a CP2102 module for USB connectivity.

See repository "PCB-111000/Documentation/leaflet" for general information and a block diagram or the original development.
