PCB111000 has beeen developed as a learning aid for the C language when applied to AVR devices.  
It consists of a USB bridge to communicate with a PC, an 8 digit display and two AVR devices. One of the AVR devices hosts a programmer and miniOS which drives the display, the other, the user device, hosts user projects.

There are three versions of PCB111000:

PCB_111000_V2 using two Atmega devices and the FTDI FT230XS USB bridge
PCB_111000_UNO_V2 A simplified plug in version for use with the UNO
PCB_111000_CP2102 Using one Atmega one ATtiny and a CP2102 module for USB connectivity.

All user projects are compiled using Arduino, system projects use Arduino or Studio 7 if needed.
The boards are set up using the UNO to host a bespoke programer.  See repository "UNO_as_an_AVR_programer". 


See repository "PCB-111000/1_Documentation/1_PCB 111000 leaflet.pdf" for general information and a block diagram of the original development.
