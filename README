PCB111000 has beeen developed as a learning aid for the C language when applied to AVR devices.  
It consists of a USB bridge to communicate with a PC, an 8 digit display and two AVR devices. 
One of the AVR devices (Atmega 328) hosts a programmer and miniOS which drives the display, 
the other (Atmega168), the user device, hosts user projects.

An I2C bus is used to link the two devices.
All user projects are compiled using Arduino, system projects use Arduino or Studio 7 if needed.
The boards are set up using the UNO to host a bespoke programer.  See repository "UNO_as_an_AVR_programer". 

See repository "PCB-111000/1_Documentation/1_PCB 111000 leaflet.pdf" for general information and a block diagram of the original development. 

There are three versions of PCB111000:

PCB_111000_V2 using two Atmega devices and the FTDI FT230XS USB bridge
PCB_111000_UNO_V2 A simplified plug in version for use with the UNO
PCB_111000_CP2102 Using one Atmega one ATtiny and a CP2102 module for USB connectivity.

In PCB_111000_UNO_V2 and PCB_111000_CP2102 the user device is an Atmega328 which hosts
a bootloader as well as the user projects.

In PCB_111000_CP2102 the I2C bus is replaced with a one wire firmware UART.


Originally 56 projects were developed for use with PCB111000.
These have been revised over the years and are now as follows

20 very short projects provided to show what a C program looks like and explore basic methods of flow control
9 projects exploring the operation of the recever transmitter (USART) block
7 projects exploring interrupts
4 projects exploring bit operatons, division and the conversion between 8 bit binary and decimal numbers
11 projects based on the Arduino USART library with reset analysis including
	Interger, prime and scientific numbers
	Integer roots and a pie estimator
	Power series to compute real number powers and trig functions
	A floating point number to string sbroutine
	Displays to simulate gravity, the pendulum and a noise waveform.
9 Projects to Illustate driving the display from the keyboard and user switches, includes a simple
calculator and floating point number to 8 digit display.
7 Projects used to build simple clocks and stop watches
6 Projects used to illustrate use of Atmel Studio 7
8 projects used to illustrate the operation of floating point numbers, tested using power series as above
and the generation of pulse and sawtooth waveforms by supperimposing sine wave upon one another.
5 projects to test the operation of the PCB during assembly
5 projects used to exlore the calibration of the RC oscillators used to clock the devices.

Any bugs:	Of course there are especially in the conversion of a floating point number to 8 digits.
		Initially I tried to fix them, but stopped.  If they are of no interest to ayone else 
		then they are of no nterest to me either.

Projects for  PCB_111000_UNO_V2 and PCB_111000_CP2102:  Projects and the mini-OS for each of these pcbs 
requires updating however both include most of the initial projects.
