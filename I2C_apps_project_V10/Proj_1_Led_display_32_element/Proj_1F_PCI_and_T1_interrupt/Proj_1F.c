/*MULTI PATTERN DISPLAY


Uses switch presses to select any one of six displays. A more ambitious program in which the inevitable 
complexity is handled by two subroutines (see below) and two interrupt service routines one triggered 
by a timer and the other by a switch press. One of the subroutines is used to initiate the display and 
the other to increment it.


IT INTRODUCES


1.	The Watch Dog Timer:
An Atmega HW device that can be programmed to generate a reset if program execution unexpectedly halts 
for any reason. It will be studied in more detail later on. 

2.	Interupts from multiple sources:
Combining a timer interrupt to increment the display with a PCI interrupt to select the display 
and initialise it.

3.	Lots of logic once again the study of most of it is probably best postponed. 

4.	Subroutines:		 
A subroutine executes a segment of code on behalf of the main routine. Subroutines may be used to make a 
program more readable especially if the code segment is required several times. Alternatively the subroutine 
may provide a service like some arithmetic that will be required by many programs.

Consider the project subroutine "void Inc_Display(char mode)".
 
It defines a variable and gives it the name "mode".  The initial value of "mode" is supplied by the statement 
"Inc_Display(switch_press)" in the "main" routine in which "switch_press" is defined as a char variable. 
The subroutine can change the value of "mode" but these changes will not effect the variable "switch_press" 
in the main routine.  The term "void" indicates that the subroutine will not be returning any value to the 
"main" routine as might be the case for an arithmetic function for example.

5. Volatile variables: 		Every variable used by the main routine is allocated permanent storage space in 
data memory. Variables only used by the subroutines or ISRs are allocated shared memory space in data memory.

However there may be some variables that are not used by the main routine but that must not be allowed to 
loose their value or be overwritten by other variables.  They also require permanent storage and are defined 
as "volatile".

Note: things do not always appear as simple as this and it is often worth checking whether or not variables 
should be declared as volatile if problems occur.*/
