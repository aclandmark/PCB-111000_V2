/*
MORE ON THE LOGIC
Note: a|b and a&b operate on the bits defined by a and b
00001010 | 10101000 = 10101010
11101010 & 10100011 = 10000010   

If  PORT_1 starts of as 00000111  
then the statement PORT_1 = PORT_1 << 1 changes it to 00001110
and the statement PORT_1 |= (PORT_1 << 1)
changes it to  
00000111 | 00001110 which equals 00001111

if PORT_1 = 1xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx then "overflow" is set to save LH 1
which will otherwise be lost at the next shift left
and subsequently place it in the most RH location
Note x either 0 or 1; LH left hand, RH right hand
