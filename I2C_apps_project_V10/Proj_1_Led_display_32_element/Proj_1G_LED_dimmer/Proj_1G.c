/*A TEST ROUTINE FOR THE DISPLAY BRIGHTNESS CONTROL.


A repeat of Proj_1A with an Interrupt on key press that toggles the brightness control.



IT INTRODUCES


1.	Project subroutine "I2C_Tx()".
This transmits data to the Atmega 328 over the I2C bus.  

2.	Pointers: 	 
Look at the ISR: It makes the following subroutine call I2C_Tx(1, 'W', &Dimmer_control); 

The "&" before the variable "Dimmer_control" means that the subroutine "I2C_Tx" expects the 
calling routine to provide the data memory location (i.e. its address) and uses and possibly 
modifies whatever data it finds in that memory location.

In this case Proj_1G defines a memory location and calls it "Dimmer_control". The subroutine 
call hands the address of "Dimmer_control" to the subroutine rather than the actual value.  


3. Subroutine "void I2C_Tx(char num_bytes, char mode, char* s){}".

This is the subroutine being called by "I2C_Tx(1, 'W', &Dimmer_control);"
It provides memory locations "num_bytes" and "mode" for the 1 and W.
The "*" signifies that it does not provide memory for variable "s" but expects the 
calling routine to provide it.

Note: "W" is the mini-OS mode that toggles the display brightness. 
The pointer is used because "I2C_Tx()" is also used to send arrays of data (to be considered later).
