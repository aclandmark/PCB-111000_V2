/*Proj_5C_Basic_crystal_clock	A crystal controlled clock provided by the mini-OS.
******************************************************************************************/


/*IT INTRODUCES


Mini-OS clock command "I2C_Tx_OS_timer(AT_clock_mode, start_time)".
An AT clock mode"  of 7 starts the clok running.
The various modes (i.e. pause, hode etc.) are saved in the "clock_stop_watch .h" file.


USER INSTRUCTIONS

Having programmed the Atmega 168 run the program and enter the time when requested which is then saved to EEPROM.
It is now possible to transfer the project pcb to an independent 5V supply and the clock will automatically start 
at the time entered.

Note:	If it is power cycled for a second time the display will remain blank until the time is re-entered from 
the PC keyboard.

Note: The short delay following POR is to allow the mini-OS to check OSCCAL (the oscillator calibration). */
