***************************************************************************/


/*IT INTRODUCES


1.	Programming the Atmega 168 EEPROM with text string for use by other programs (known as client programs).

2.	Project subroutine "Text_to_EEPROM()".
This saves blocks of text rather than individual characters.

3.	Project subroutine "Text_from_EEPROM()".
This reads blocks of text rather than individual characters.

4.	Project subroutine "binUnwantedChars_dot()".
When a file is being read by project code and its length exceeds a defined value, this subroutine can be used 
to discard the remaining characters echoing each with a '.' so that the file download can complete properly.
Note: there is also a similar subroutine "binUnwantedChars()": 
This does not echo discarded characters.

5.	Project subroutine "Read_on_chip_EEPROM()".
This is used by the client program to read the text strings.




PROGRAM OPERATION


Proj_6F allows users to put text strings in the EEPROM rather than in program memory.  Text string are composed 
in a .txt file.  This is downloaded and the strings copied to EEPROM.

The strings are echoed to the PC screen along with their addresses.  These must be copied manually into the header 
file along with the names of the messages for use by the client programs.  See "Proj_6F_header_file.h" for examples.

For test purposes two .txt files are used with this program.
Segments of the client programs are included in this program for illustrative purposes.

Note: 	The first 10 locations are reserved for use by the client programs for non text based use.
This number can be increased or reduced even to zero if needed using the variable “write_address”.
		
Locations 0x1F7 and 0x1F8 are used for 8MHz clock oscillator calibration bytes.  If these get corrupted they can 
be restored using "Proj_9B_168_auto_cal".*/
