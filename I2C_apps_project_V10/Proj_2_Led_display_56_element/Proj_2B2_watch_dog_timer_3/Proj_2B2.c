/*SNOW STORM DISPLAY VERSION 3


IT INTRODUCES:


1.	Interrupt Service Routine "ISR (WDT_vect){}":
This ISR is called by the watch dog timer when it is operating in its Interrupt and System Reset Mode.

When the WDT times out it initially issues an interrupt and program execution jumps to "ISR (WDT_vect){}" 
which saves the PRN value to the EEPROM. The WDT then resets itself and when it times out for a second time 
it resets the Atmega 168.  This time the program reads the PRN value from the EEPROM and continues driving 
the display from where it left off.

2.	Global variable "watch_dog_reset".

The first line of "setup_HW" sets up the watchdog and leaves it ready to receive a "wdt_enable()" command. 
The first line of "setup_watchdog" checks the status register and if the current reset is due to the WDT it 
sets "watch_dog_reset" to 1.
The firm ware (FW) therefore knows whether it has just been triggered by the WDT or by some other means 
i.e. a POR or by exiting programming mode. 

3.	Project subroutines "Char_to_EEPROM()" used to save data to the EEPROM and "Char_from_EEPROM()" used to 
read the EEPROM.


Note:  The display always starts with all ones when it is switched on or immediately after programming but 
continues from where it was when interrupted by the WDT.


Press sw_2 to operate the WDT.*/
